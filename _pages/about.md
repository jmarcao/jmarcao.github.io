Hey, I'm John :wave:

Since you're on my Github page, you're probably most interested in what I do for a living. I'm an embedded software engineer, focusing on embedded Linux platforms, drivers, and applications. My focus is on tackling difficult problems where memory and processor time are at a premium, though thats almost every embedded software engineer. You need to enjoy the pain a little.

Outside of work, I'm happily enagaged and spend my free time, as much as I have, diving into my hobbies: nature and hiking, animals, hobbyist mathematics, and Magic the Gathering.
